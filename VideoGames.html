                        </div>

                          <h4>I play video games.</h4>
                          <p>I've enjoyed video games since I was in the first grade, and my dad bought me a Nintendo DS Lite for my 6th birthday. I stayed with the handheld consoles throughout most of elementary school, playing casual games such as Pokemon, Mario, and Zelda. When I hit 5rd grade, my family gifted me an Xbox 360 for Christmas. It was then that I started to explore more games and genres. I practically lived on Halo 3 ODST's multiplayer servers during the summer before middle school. Call of Duty: Black Ops became my go-to stress reliever throughout middle school.</p>

                          <br>

                          <p>I moved houses during the summer before 7th grade, and one of new friends was really into PC gaming. After observing him play complex games that I had never even heard of, I was determined to get into PC gaming. I built a gaming pc when I was 16 (parts list can be found on the Technology page on this site), and have been playing PC games as my hobby ever since. Some of my favorite games of all time that I've played on my PC are Titanfall, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>

                          <h4>I watch competetive video games.</h4>

                          <p>or eSports, if you would prefer that I use the appropriate term. Something about watching 2 players or teams at the top of the game's skill cap playing against each other for high stakes has been super interesting to me. Ever since I've been into PC games, I've kept up with multiple eSports, like League of Legends, Call of Duty, and Counter Strike. As of now, the only two eSports that I currently follow avidly are Counter Strike and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. I've been to ESL New York, a tournament for Counter Strike, as a spectator, for two years running. My favorite teams and organizations are FaZe Clan, Team Liquid and Cloud9.</p>
