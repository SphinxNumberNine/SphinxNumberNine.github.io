                                <h3>The Optional Features of Motherboards: Which Ones Do You Really Need??? <small>Posted on July 11th</small></h3>
                            </div>
                            <img class = "featuredimg" src = "http://images.anandtech.com/doci/8449/Project_03%20.jpg" width = "100%">
                            <p>Buying a motherboard can be incredibly tricky. They have so many things to consider. But what the manufacturers don't want you to know is that not all of those things are actually necessary in your motherboard. Some of the features are simply nothing more than excuses to jack up the price. But how do you know which ones? Well, you're about to find out.</p>    
                            <h4>CrossFire/SLI</h4>
                            <p>For those of you who don't know what this means, SLI and Crossfire are two ways of using more than one graphics card in your machine, to slightly increase performance. Only 5% of PC builders actually use this feature, because of the price required to buy 2 of the same identical card. So if you are not too keen about splurging upwards of half a grand on multiple graphics cards, feel free to exclude this feature from the motherboard you buy. However, if you only have one card now, but there is a chance you may want to add one later, you may want to consider this feature, just in case.</p>
                            <h4>Plate Shielding</h4>
                            <p>This can be seen in the image above. Those plastic pieces you see on the motherboard are plate shields. They supposedly block off things like the sound card and onboard graphics from being affected by static charge when the system is running. But static charge only has a visible effect on systems 10 years in the future. If you are building a sweetspot rig that will be replaced within 10 years, don't bother with this feature. </p>
                            <h4>USB 3.0</h4>
                            <p>This is a debateable one, because there are people who will tell you this one is necessary. Basically, the benefit of this feature is fast file transfers when transfering large amounts of data. But there is only a visible benefit when transfering more than 50gb or so. If you do not plan to make such large transfers, you don't need this feature, but it's still pretty good to have, just in case. </p>
