                            <p>Peripherals. They encompass many things. The monitor, the keyboard, the speakers, and the mouse. In this article, I'll be giving you my recommendations for the best peripherals. Keep in mind, this is not going to be budget oriented, since I do not believe in skimping out on peripherals. A set of peripherals can last you through 3 or more computers if you buy them so that they match your needs now and for the future. So strap in, because here we go. </p>
                            <h4>Monitor: Asus ROG Swift PG278Q</h4>
                            <p>This is the best monitor out there in my opinion. It features the most ideal resolution and refresh rate (1440p @ 144hz), and has an IPS panel for better looking colors. It also allows for G-Sync (look at my AMD vs Nvidia comparison), which is a bonus on most monitors. It also looks pretty sick, with its sick looking black and red finish. But these positives come with a hefty premium. This monitor will set you back $600.</p>
                            <h4>Mouse: Logitech g502: Proteus Core</h4>
                            <p>Programmable buttons, ergonomic shape, high DPI range, and a low price. What else can you ask for? This beautiful gaming mouse from Logitech has 11 programmable buttons that can be mapped with Logitech's amazing Gaming Software. The shape also fits most right handed people VERY well, if not perfectly. The only drawback here is that it is kind of heavy, but it comes with weights that you can put inside the mouse depending on how fast you can snap your wrist and move the mouse with the different weights in it.</p>
                            <h4>Keyboard: Corsair Vengeance k95 RGB</h4>
                            <p>Well, Corsair has done it. They have created the perfect keyboard (in my opinion of course). This keyboard sports a full RGB backlight, for nearly 18 million colors and combinations. The keyboard features Cherry MX Blue switches, which are specialized for gaming and typing. They have a certain click when you press them down, making for an overall responsive experience. The keyboard also features programmable macro-keys on the side, which can be programmed with the Corsair software. However, perfection isn't cheap. And neither is 18 million colors. This keyboard's base model starts at $190 (but it is SO worth it, as I have seen. I currently use this one).</p>
