                            <p>The AMD vs Nvidia debate is not as simple as the Intel vs AMD debate, for many reasons. For one, graphics hardware is always changing. AMD has just released their new r9-300 series of graphics cards. Nvidia released their new graphics card, the GTX Titan X, just 2 months ago, and have already leaked the release date for a new card (the GTX 950 and 950ti will be released next week). The second thing to consider is that each manufacturer has their own proprietary software and API's that directly affect certain games. For example, Nvidia has Gameworks, which boosts performance in games such as ARK: Survival Evolved, Killing Floor 2, and Project CARS. AMD, however, has Mantle, which auto-detects the slowest component in your system and takes unnecessary load off of it when you are gaming. AMD and Nvidia have Free-Sync and G-Sync, respectively, which uses a "variable refresh rate" to make gameplay seem more smooth than it actually is. Nvidia has shadowplay, which allows you to record a sick shot that you got 2 minutes ago with a press of a button. AMD has Raptr, which allows for easy streaming capability to Twitch. The list goes on and on. And lastly, they have specific drawbacks. AMD graphics cards are usually hotter and consume more power, while Nvidia cards cost a bit more. Unlike the Intel vs AMD review, I will not be looking at price ranges. Rather, I will be taking a look at 3 sets of cards that people usually have to choose between. So let's get started.</p> <br>
                            <h4>Nvidia GeForce GTX 750ti vs AMD Radeon r7 260X</h4>
                            <p>This is the competition of the low end cards. Both of these cards can be bought under $120, and both delever solid framerates if all you want is to play low-res "e-sports" titles like League of Legends, Dota 2, or Counter Strike: Global Offensive. But when you start to get into the higher res titles like Titanfall, Battlefield 4, and Grand Theft Auto 5, the r7 260x starts to fall behind. The GTX 750ti wins this head to head.</p> <br>
                            <h4>AMD r9 280X vs Nvidia GeForce GTX 960</h4>
                            <p>This is the "bang for the buck" sweetspot. Both of these cards will max out settings in games at 1080p with beautiful framerates. But the way to truly put these cards head to head is to use them in higher resolutions, like 1440p, and 2160p. Because of Gameworks on the Nvidia side, the GTX 960 pulls ahead slightly in the games that support Gameworks. But in games that do not support it, the cards are about equal, and the 960 usually costs less, uses less power, and emits less heat. GTX 960 all the way.</p><br>
                            <h4>AMD r9 Fury X vs Nvidia GeForce GTX 980ti</h4>
                            <p>This is the battle of the cards that just came out, and they both have a couple of benefits and drawbacks. In usual Nvidia fashion, the 980ti uses less power and emits less heat. The Fury X is cooled better, because it is cooled with water right out of the box, with no water cooling installation required. But because these cards are the same price, the way to test them head to head is simple: look at the numbers in high-res games at a 4k resolution. And, unfortunately for AMD, they lose this one too. The 980ti pulls ahead in almost every game, regardless of Gameworks. The 980ti is the clear choice here.</p><br>
                            <p>And there you have it. At this point in time, Nvidia is the superior manufacturer. In no way am I sayhing AMD is bad. I am just saying that in the closest races between two cards, Nvidia always pulls ahead. But that could change, very soon, depending on the new hardware, because like I said, graphics is constantly evolving.</p>
