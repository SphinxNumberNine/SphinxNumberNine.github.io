                            <h3>AMD vs Intel <small>posted on July 9th</small></h3>
                        </div>
                        <img class = "featuredimg" src = "img/intel_vs_amd.jpg" width = "100%">
                        <p>The big question is here: AMD or Intel? Well it is simply not that simple. Both of these companies have their benefits and drawbacks. And they both have processors that are worth buying. I am going to break down the three different price tiers (sub $100, $100-250, and above $250) and tell you guys which specific processor is best for the money in that price range. </p>
                        <h4>Low Range (sub $100)</h4>
                        <p>Ah, the budget buyers. Their needs are kind of irrational. A machine that delivers similar performance to high end PC's for fractions of the cost? Get real, budgeters! I'm exaggerating here, because I, too was a budget buyer at one point. The processor I ended up buying was the AMD Athlon x4 760k. While this is still a great option for around $75, we are 2 years ahead of when that processor was released. Now, the two processors that compete at this price range are the Intel Pentium g3258 Anniversary Edition ($62), and the AMD FX-6300 ($94). Both of these processors are great options. The Intel chip has 2 cores, but has GREAT single core performance, and is rocking a core clock of 3.2 ghz. But this chip has so much overclocking headroom that you can EASILY push this one to 4.4 or 4.5 ghz. The AMD chip, the FX-6300, has a whopping 6 cores, but the single core performance is very subpar. However, the AMD chip has very solid overclocking capability as well. The chip comes in at 3.5 ghz, and you can easily get 4.6 or 4.7, depending on your CPU cooling solution. However, the AMD chip does get rather hot, so watch out if you do not have a good cooler or proper airflow in your case. My vote here goes to the AMD FX-6300 for the overwhelming amount of cores. </p>
                        <h4>Mid-Range ($100 to $250)</h4>
                        <p>Here is where we get to 90% of people buying processors. This is commonly where you will find the best "bang for the buck" performance. The two main processors competing in this range are the AMD FX-8350 ($180), and the Intel Core i5 4690k ($225). The AMD processor has an astounding 8 cores, with the same subpar single core performance that the FX-6300 has. This chip doesnt have that much overclocking headroom, but it doesn't matter, since it comes in at a core clock of 4.2 ghz right out of the box. The Intel Core i5 on the other hand, only has 4 cores, but features Intel's proprietary "hyperthreading" technology, so each core is split into 2 threads, so that what is really a 4 core processor has the performance of an 8 core processor. On top of that, the single core performance on this chip is incredible, to the point where I could shut off 3 of the cores and the fourth one could render a video in the same amount of time that a 6 core AMD chip could while using all of its cores. And if you didn't need more convincing, the chip was able to get a STABLE 5.0 ghz overclock from the stock 3.5, when I tried it in my machine (this is the chip I currently use). The choice here is obvious: the Intel Core i5 4690k gets my vote.</p>
                        <h4>Enthusiast Range (above $250)</h4>
                        <p>Enthusiasts. The ones who will pay insane amounts of money just to say that they have the best of the best hardware in their system. Someone I know is one of these people. He spent $1000 on his processor ALONE (he has the Core i7 5960X). And while that processor is an absolute BEAST, that doesn't mean that it is worth paying $1000 for if you are only looking for gaming performance. The two processors that compete in this price range are the AMD FX-9590 ($260) and the Intel Core i7 4790k ($330). In my opinion, there is only one real choice here. The FX-9590 is just an overclocked version of the FX-8350 CPU. Why would you pay $80 more to overclock a chip, when you can do it for free! The Core i7 4790k comes out of the box with 4 hyperthreaded cores, a clock speed of 4.0 ghz, and has the same single core performance that the 4690k has. On top of which, Intel's drivers make the hyperthreading on this chip look like the chip has 16 cores! There is no real competition from AMD here. Intel all the way, in this price range. </p>
